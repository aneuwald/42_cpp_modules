The voice of the Lord is over the waters.
The God of glory thunders,
The Lord, over many waters.
The voice of the Lord is powerful.
The voice of the Lord is full of majesty.

The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars.
The Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon.
He makes Lebanon to skip like a calf,
and Sirion like a young wild ox.

The voice of the Lord flashes forth flames of fire.
The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness.
The Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.

The voice of the Lord makes the deer give birth
and strips the forests bare,
and in his temple all cry, "Glory!"

Let England have its navigation and fleet.
Let Scotland have its navigation and fleet.
Let Wales have its navigation and fleet.
Let Ireland have its navigation and fleet.
Let those four of the constituent parts of the
British empirebe under four independent governments,
and it is easy to perceive how soon they would
each dwindle into comparative insignificance.
